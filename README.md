# VideoGameEDA

## About

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focus on the [Video Game Sales With Ratings](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings) Dataset. As passionate gamers, we were curious as to how each video did in different ears under different region. As such, we have decided to analyse this dataset to see what insights we can gain.

## Dataset Introduction 
![image](resources/dataset.png)


The dataset consists of about 17000 entries and 16 unique columns. These columns include variables such as platforms. genres, publishers and many more. Upon seeing the variables, we were interested in how each variable could affect the potential sales in different regions.
With that in mind, as passionate gamers and pontentially furture game developers, the question that came to our mind was: 
## Objective
- How do we make the most sales out of a game?
- Which variables would be the best at predicting global sales?

For a detailed walkthrough of our project:
## Content
1. [Complete Notebook]()
2. [EDA](EDA.ipynb)
3. [Machine Learning](machineLearning.ipynb)
4. [Python functions for this project](resources/edafunctions.py)

## Models used in this project:
- Linear Regression
- Gradient-Boosting Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbour Regression


## Conclusion


We realised that the variables in the dataset were not enough to predict Global sales, as there are many other factors that could affect how popular and successful a game can be. Take Wii sports for example, which was an innovative game that implemented real life action into video games to simulate playing the real sport. Wii sportâ€™s success could be attributed to its innovation to not imitate other existing games, but rather create a game that was never seen before. As such, factors like creativity, constant developer updates, beta testing and such could result in a more successful game and consequently higher sales. With that in mind, perhaps there is more to creating a high-selling video game than just the platforms, publishers, genres and such. Instead, its success is also attributed together with the mindset of the developers to ensure the game stays relevant and innovative.
